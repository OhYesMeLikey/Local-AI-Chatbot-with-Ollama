# ðŸ¤– Local AI Chatbot with Ollama

(FOR TESTING AND LEARNING PURPOSES)
A simple Python chatbot that runs on your computer using Ollama, specifically to mask sensistive data.

## What is this?

This is a test project to see how good a local AI chatbot can be. Instead of using ChatGPT or Claude online, this chatbot runs entirely on your own computer.

**Tutorial I followed:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0o89z134CQ

## What you need

- **Python 3.10** (NOT Python 3.12 - it doesn't work!)
- **Windows 11** (that's what I used)
- **Ollama** installed on your computer

## Important note about Python versions

I tried using Python 3.12 first, but it didn't work. I had trouble installing the required packages (langchain and ollama). 

**Solution:** Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 instead. It works perfectly!

## How to use

1. Install Python 3.10
2. Install Ollama
3. Download the code
4. Install the required packages
5. Run the chatbot

## My results (Updated July 8, 2025)

After testing, here's what I found:

- **Local AI (Ollama):** Works, but not amazing
- **GPT-4.1:** Much better responses
- **Claude Sonnet 4:** Also much better responses

**Bottom line:** Local AI is cool for privacy, but online AI is still way better for quality.

## Why use local AI?

- **Privacy:** Everything stays on your computer
- **No internet needed:** Works offline
- **Free:** No monthly subscriptions
- **Learning:** Great way to understand how AI works

## Problems I ran into

- Python 3.12 compatibility issues
- Had to downgrade to Python 3.10
- Local AI responses aren't as good as online versions
