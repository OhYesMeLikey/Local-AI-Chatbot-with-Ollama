Note: This was done in Python 3.10 in Windows 11 as Python 3.12 didn't support langchain, ollama, or both. I don't remember the specific error that I got, but I think my error was that I had trouble installing dependencies for Python 3.12. Claude suggested that I should just downgrade to Python 3.10 or 3.11, and I was able to finally install the dependencies. 

Edit: As of 2025-07-08, GPT4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4 produced WAY BETTER expected results than my local LLM.
